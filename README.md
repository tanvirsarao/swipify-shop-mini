# Swypify - Shopify Minis Hackathon Finalist

Swypify is a Shopify Shop Mini that lets users swipe through curated outfit photos, get style‑based product recommendations, and virtually try on items - all without leaving the Shop app. It was built in TypeScript/React using the Shop Minis SDK with a focus on a polished user experience.

## Features

Swipe to Discover – Users can swipe through outfit photos to indicate styles they like. Each swipe updates the recommendation engine.

Personalized Recommendations – Based on liked outfits, Swypify surfaces a list of products with context‑aware reasons (e.g. “You liked Athleisure styles”). Products are fetched from Shopify and can be added to the cart with one tap.

Virtual Try‑On – Users can upload or take a photo and our integration with the Fashn.ai API generates a realistic try‑on preview. The app guides the user through upload, processing and result, and allows adding the item to the cart directly from the try‑on screen.

Integrated Cart & Checkout – A simple cart screen allows adjusting quantities, removing items, and simulating a secure checkout flow. Subtotal, tax and total are calculated on the fly.
